    <h1>atammmmmmm</h1>
    <p>In dawn’s embrace, where shadows shift and play,<br>
    A leader rose to guide a nation’s way.<br>
    His name, Atatürk, in hearts engraved so deep,<br>
    Awake the dreams for which the people weep.</p>
    
    <p>From Anatolia’s rugged, ancient lands,<br>
    He sculpted hope with tireless, steady hands.<br>
    The scepter of reform in his grasp, so bold,<br>
    He cast a vision, bright and manifold.</p>
    
    <p>Through strife and storm, his clarity did shine,<br>
    A compass true, a heart both fierce and kind.<br>
    He carved the path where freedom’s light could beam,<br>
    And shaped a modern world from ancient dreams.</p>
    
    <p>In schools and fields where once the past did sleep,<br>
    He sowed the seeds for futures wide and deep.<br>
    A republic born, from ashes, firm and grand,<br>
    With unity, he forged the promised land.</p>
    
    <p>So let his name in reverence be sung,<br>
    A beacon bright for every soul among.<br>
    For in his story, hope and courage blend,<br>
    A legacy on which the ages depend.</p>
