    <h1>༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ</h1>

    <p>Oh Ataturk, father of the land,<br>
    With wisdom and courage, you took a stand.<br>
    For freedom and progress, you paved the way,<br>
    Your <a href="https://www.add.org.tr/ataturk/genclige-hitabe/" id="link">legacy</a> shines bright, even to this day.</p>

    <p>Through battles and hardship, he never lost his stride,<br>
    A leader and a warrior, with honor as his guide.<br>
    He taught us to be fearless, to dream and to aspire,<br>
    To build a better future, to always reach higher.</p>
   
    <p>Through the storm and the struggle, he forged a path of light,<br>
    For a nation born from shadows, emerging in the night.
    For the father of our nation, we lift our voices high,<br>
    Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, forever in our sky.</p>

    <p>In the hearts of the people, his spirit still remains,<br>
    Guiding us through trials, through sunshine and the rains.<br>
    Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, your vision led the way,<br>
    We honor you in memory, every single day.</p>

    <p>From the past to the future, your light will always guide,<br>
    In the soul of Turkey, your dreams will never die.<br>
    Mustafa Kemal <a href="https://www.add.org.tr/ataturk/bursa-nutku/" id="link">Ataturk</a>, your name forever strong,<br>
    In every heart that beats, you live on in our song.</p>
