    <h2>[ BREAKPOINT ]</h2>
      <p>
        In the vast and shimmering ocean, there lived a shark named Splash.
        Splash wasn't like the other sharks. He was smaller and quieter, and he
        didn't swim as fast or as boldly as his peers. While the other sharks
        roamed in packs, Splash often found himself swimming alone, feeling like
        an outcast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each day, as the sun peeked through the waves, Splash watched with
        longing as the other sharks glided gracefully through the water, their
        sleek bodies cutting through the ocean currents. But whenever Splash
        tried to join them, he felt a wave of fear wash over him. What if they
        laughed at him? What if he couldn't keep up?
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, while Splash was swimming near the coral reef, he spotted a
        school of colorful fish darting playfully among the coral branches.
        Their laughter echoed through the water, filling Splash's heart with a
        pang of loneliness. He longed to be part of their joyful world, but his
        fear held him back.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Splash watched from a distance, he noticed something strange. A
        shadowy figure lurked in the shadows, its jagged teeth glinting in the
        sunlight. It was a fierce-looking predator, known as the Great White
        Shark, feared by all creatures of the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other fish scattered in fear, but Splash felt a strange sense of
        curiosity. Despite his fear, he couldn't help but be drawn to the Great
        White Shark. Perhaps, he thought, even the fiercest creatures have fears
        of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summoning all his courage, Splash swam closer to the Great White Shark.
        To his surprise, the fearsome predator didn't chase him away. Instead,
        it regarded him with a curious gleam in its eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who are you, little shark?" the Great White Shark asked, its voice deep
        and rumbling.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm Splash," he replied timidly. "I'm just a shark who doesn't quite
        fit in."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great White Shark nodded knowingly. "I understand, Splash. Many
        creatures fear me because of my size and strength. But deep down, I am
        just like you—a creature with hopes and fears of my own."
      </p>
      <p>
        Splash was amazed. He had always thought of the Great White Shark as a
        terrifying monster, but now he saw it in a different light—as a fellow
        creature struggling to find its place in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they swam together through the ocean depths, the Great White Shark
        shared stories of its own journey, of battles fought and fears
        conquered. With each tale, Splash felt a glimmer of hope stirring within
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by the Great White Shark's bravery, Splash decided to face his
        own fears head-on. With the Great White Shark by his side, he returned
        to the reef where the other fish frolicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, the other fish were wary of Splash's presence. But as they saw
        him swimming confidently alongside the Great White Shark, their fears
        melted away. Soon, they welcomed Splash into their midst, eager to hear
        tales of his adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that day on, Splash was no longer an outcast. He had found his
        place among the creatures of the sea, thanks to the courage he had
        discovered within himself and the friendship of the Great White Shark.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sun set on the horizon, casting a golden glow over the ocean,
        Splash knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, he would always
        have the strength and bravery to overcome them. And with the Great White
        Shark by his side, he would never be alone again.
