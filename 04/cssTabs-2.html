                <h2>Wings of Tomorrow</h2>
                <p>Eun-joo (late 20s, introverted, determined) is a successful, yet lonely, architect living in Seoul. She has a perfect career but is struggling to connect with her emotions after a traumatic event in her past. Despite her accomplishments, her heart is closed off, and she constantly feels like something is missing.</p>
                <p>One day, while working late in her office, Eun-joo encounters Ji-hoon (early 30s, warm, charming, but secretive). Ji-hoon is a mysterious man who appears out of nowhere, claiming to be a fallen angel sent from the future. He tells Eun-joo that she is destined to help him repair his broken wings in order to save the world from an impending disaster that will occur in 30 days.</p>
                <p>At first, Eun-joo thinks Ji-hoon is delusional, but as strange and supernatural events start to unfold, she begins to believe him. Her once-sturdy world is upended as she becomes involved in a love story that transcends time and space. Alongside Ji-hoon, she embarks on a journey of discovery, not only about the future but also about her own hidden strength and emotions.</p>
                <p>As they grow closer, Eun-joo finds herself torn between two worlds: her duty to help Ji-hoon repair his wings and her blossoming feelings for him. Meanwhile, Ji-hoon must confront his own painful past, and the reason his wings are broken is much more personal than he initially lets on. The clock is ticking, and both are forced to confront the idea of sacrifice, love, and the future they could create together.</p>
